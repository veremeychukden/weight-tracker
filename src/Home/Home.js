                            Eating a well-balanced diet can help you get the calories and nutrients you need to
                            fuel your daily activities, including regular exercise. When it comes to eating foods
                            to fuel your exercise performance, itâ€™s not as simple as choosing vegetables over doughnuts.
                            You need to eat the right types of food at the right times of the day.
